# Housing Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning models. We utilize the California housing dataset to train and evaluate various algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The analysis helps in understanding the impact of different features on housing prices.
